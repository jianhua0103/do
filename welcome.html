<h1>Really Honest Book Reviews</h1>
<p> I read a lot of books about many different subjects. Though I'm not a book critic,and I don't do this for a living,
I enjoy a really good read every now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="rainbow.html"><em>The Rainbow Returns</em> by E.Smith</a>.A fantasy story set in biblical times.Slow at times,but interesting.</li>
  <li><a href="wealth.html"><em>Seven Steps to Immeasurable Wealth</em> by R.U.Needy</a>.I'm still poor, but I'm happy!And that's the whole point.</li>
  <li><a href="food.html"><em>The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</em> by L.Goode</a>.At last! A diet book with recipes that taste good!</li>
  <li><a href="silly.html"><em>the Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</em> by M.Nott</a>.Come on...who wants to be serious?</li>
